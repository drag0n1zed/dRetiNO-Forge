# dRetiNO-Forge

A simple, essential FPS-boosting mod for Minecraft Forge on macOS.

This mod disables Retina rendering, forcing the game to render at 25% of the native pixel amount. This dramatically improves performance on all retina-enabled macOS systems.

## Installation

0.  Get Forge 1.20.1. (Not tested on higher versions or NeoForge, some versions MAY work)
1.  Drop the JAR into your `mods` folder.
2.  **Launch the game once.**
3.  **Close the game.**
4.  Relaunch and enjoy your higher FPS!

> **Why the restart?** The mod automatically patches a config file on the first run. The fix is active on the second run and all future launches.

This is a client-side mod.
